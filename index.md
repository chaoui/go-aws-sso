# go-aws-sso

Make working with AWS SSO on local machines an ease.

## What is it about?

* Choose and retrieve short-living role credentials from all of your SSO available accounts and roles
* No nasty manual copy and pasting of credentials

### But... why? ü§î
* You have one go-to binary
* No external dependencies (e.g. a python runtime)
* Forget about dealing with different profiles and role names, just choose them directly!

## Getting Started

### Installation
* a) Download your according target platform binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/theurichde/go-aws-sso/releases)
* b) Compile from source with `go build -v ./cmd/go-aws-sso`
* c) use `go install github.com/theurichde/go-aws-sso/cmd/go-aws-sso@main`
  * Maybe you want to make sure your GOBIN is in your PATH üòâ

### Usage
* Just execute `go-aws-sso`
  * When you run `go-aws-sso` the first time, you will be prompted for your SSO Start URL and your region
  * A config file (located at  `$HOME/.aws/go-aws-sso-config.yaml`) will be written with your values
* ‚ùî Verify your client request if necessary 
* ‚úÖ Choose the account you want the roles to be displayed
* ‚úÖ Choose a role
    * in case there is only one role available this role is taken as default
* ü•≥ Tadaa ü•≥ short living credentials are written to `~/.aws/credentials`
